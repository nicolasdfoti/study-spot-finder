          <h2>About Us: Where the spots find themselves</h2>
          <p>
            It all started with a simple frustration: not finding a quiet place to study. 
            Between crowded cafes, closed libraries, or overly noisy parks, the idea of ​​creating something more was born.
            Study Spot Finder emerged as a project between friends who shared the same need: 
            to find that perfect spot to concentrate, learn, and feel at peace.
            Today, our mission is to help you discover that ideal place, close to you, 
            where you can focus, be inspired, or simply breathe. 
            Because we believe that a good spot can change everything. And that place exists. You just have to find it.
